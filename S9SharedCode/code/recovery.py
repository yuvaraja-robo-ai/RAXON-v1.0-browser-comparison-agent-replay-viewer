"""Failure classification and recovery decisions for the orchestrator.

Two surfaces:

  - `classify_failure(error_text)` buckets a failure into one of
    {transient, validation_error, upstream_failure} so the orchestrator
    can tell apart a gateway 503 from a malformed plan from a genuine
    upstream miss (NOTES_RUNS round-2 review P0 #3).

  - `plan_recovery(...)` is the predicate the Executor consults to
    decide WHAT to do with a failure: "skip", "replan", or "critic_fail".
    Concentrating the if/elif tree here keeps `flow.Executor.run`
    focused on graph mechanics and lets the recovery policy be unit-
    tested in isolation.

The orchestrator imports `plan_recovery` and acts on the returned
`RecoveryDecision` — it does not branch on classifier output itself.
