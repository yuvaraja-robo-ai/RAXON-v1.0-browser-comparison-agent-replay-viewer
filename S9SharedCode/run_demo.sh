# Session 9 demo runner.
#
# Run the unit-test suite, then walk through a curated set of queries
# that each exercise one orchestrator feature. Every query's stdout is
# teed into S9/logs/<slug>.log so students can re-read it after the
# live demo. After each run, the script prints the session id and a
# one-liner showing how to inspect a node's exact rendered prompt.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_demo.sh              run pytest + the 5 canonical queries
#   ./run_demo.sh tests        only pytest
#   ./run_demo.sh hello        smallest DAG (planner → formatter)
#   ./run_demo.sh shannon      single-item query (USER_QUERY flow)
#   ./run_demo.sh populations  parallel fan-out (per-worker scoping)
#   ./run_demo.sh structured   forces distiller → auto-critic chain
#   ./run_demo.sh fail         graceful-fail-by-planning
#   ./run_demo.sh browser      Session 9 Browser skill end-to-end
#   ./run_demo.sh wipe         clear state/sessions + logs
#
# Requires the V9 gateway running on :8109 (start with
#   cd ../llm_gatewayV9 && uv run main.py
# ).

DEMO: hello
  Shape         planner -> formatter
  Demonstrates  Smallest possible DAG. The planner correctly decides
                no research is needed and routes straight to the
                formatter. Inspect n_001.json to see the planner's
                emitted plan; n_002.json shows the formatter's prompt
                contains USER_QUERY because the planner listed it.
EOF
      ;;
    shannon)
      cat <<'EOF'
DEMO: shannon
  Shape         planner -> researcher -> formatter
  Demonstrates  Single-item query. Researcher receives USER_QUERY in
                its inputs because there is nothing to fan out over.
                The researcher's prompt_sent contains USER_QUERY but
                no QUESTION block (the planner did not need to scope
                the worker).
EOF
      ;;
    populations)
      cat <<'EOF'
DEMO: populations
  Shape         planner -> researcher x 3 (parallel) -> formatter
  Demonstrates  Per-worker scoping via metadata.question. Each
                researcher sees only its own city (in QUESTION:), NOT
                the full USER_QUERY. Inspect each researcher node:
                  - inputs    -> []
                  - QUESTION  -> "current population of <one city>"
                If you saw all three cities in INPUTS that would be
                the pre-patch leak that S8/S9 used to have.
EOF
      ;;
    structured)
      cat <<'EOF'
DEMO: structured
  Shape         planner -> researcher x N -> distiller -> CRITIC -> formatter
  Demonstrates  Session 9 critic auto-insertion fix. The planner
                pre-wires distiller -> formatter; the orchestrator
                detects distiller is critic:true and splices a critic
                in automatically. The auto-inserted critic gets
                USER_QUERY in its inputs so it judges against the
                real ask (not stale memory hits). Inspect the critic
                node: prompt_sent must contain USER_QUERY and the
                distiller's output; verdict + rationale appear in
                the result.output.
EOF
      ;;
    fail)
      cat <<'EOF'
DEMO: fail
  Shape         planner -> formatter (graceful-fail-by-planning)
  Demonstrates  The planner recognises a doomed input upfront (a
                nonexistent file path) and routes directly to the
                formatter with an honest "could not be done" answer
                instead of scheduling a retriever guaranteed to
                fail. Total cost: two LLM calls. No recovery branch
                fires because nothing failed at runtime.
EOF
      ;;
    browser)
      cat <<'EOF'
DEMO: browser
  Shape         planner -> browser -> distiller? -> formatter
  Demonstrates  The Session 9 Browser skill. Routes through the
                four-layer cascade (extract -> deterministic -> a11y
                -> vision). Per-turn artifacts (marked screenshots,
                legends) land in state/sessions/<sid>/browser/.
                Requires Playwright + V9 vision endpoint.
